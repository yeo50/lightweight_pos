    D'ARTAGNAN
    <P>One morning in April, 1624, the little French town of Meung was in a state of great excitement. In those times,
        fighting was common in france . The King fought Richelieu, and ambitious cardinal. Noble families fought among
        them-selves, and Spain was always ready to wage war with France. Few days passed without trouble in some town or
        another. On this day, a crowd had gathered outside the town's inn. The cause of all the stir was the arrival of
        a young man on a very odd horse. It looked so comical that many of the townspeople wanted to laugh. Only the
        length of the sword at the young man's side, and the proud glean in his eye, stopped them. The young man's side,
        and the proud gleam in his eye, stopped them.</P>
